As a PhD in Computer Science and Biomedical Technologist, I develop advanced algorithms to enhance breast cancer detection through mammograms. Using Python and C++, I create software that improves diagnostic precision and supports doctors with better tools. 

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling through the countryside or diving into science fiction novels.
